&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall Job Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will provide a professional, first class level of customer service. Above everything, it&amp;rsquo;s about putting our customers at the heart of every decision you make, using your discernment to support them and provide advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will be required to answer servicing queries along with helping our Vitality members understand how they can improve their health, make it cheaper to get healthy and how they can receive rewards to keep them motivated.
